# P(romise) Queue

> Promise queue with concurrency control

Useful for rate-limiting async (or sync) operations. For example, when interacting with a REST API or when doing CPU/memory intensive tasks.

## Usage

Here we run only one promise at the time. For example, set `concurrency` to 4 to run four promises at the same time.

``` js
import PQueue from 'https://deno.land/x/p_queue@1.0.0/mod.ts'

const queue = new PQueue({
    concurrency: 1
})

async function one () {
    await queue.add(() => fetch('https://sindresorhus.com'))
    console.log('Done: sindresorhus.com')
}

async function two () {
    await queue.add(() => fetch('https://avajs.dev'))
    console.log('Done: avajs.dev')
}

async function three () {
    const task = await getUnicornTask()
    await queue.add(task)
    console.log('Done: Unicorn task')
}

one()
two()
three()
```

## API

See https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/p_queue@1.0.0/mod.ts

## Events

### active

Emitted as each item is processed in the queue for the purpose of tracking progress.

``` js
import PQueue from 'https://deno.land/x/p_queue@1.0.0/mod.ts'
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))

const queue = new PQueue({
    concurrency: 2
})

let count = 0
queue.on('active', () => {
    console.log(`Working on item #${++count}.  Size: ${queue.size}  Pending: ${queue.pending}`)
})

queue.add(() => Promise.resolve())
queue.add(() => delay(2000))
queue.add(() => Promise.resolve())
queue.add(() => Promise.resolve())
queue.add(() => delay(500))
```

### idle

Emitted every time the queue becomes empty and all promises have completed `queue.size === 0 && queue.pending === 0` .

``` js
import PQueue from 'https://deno.land/x/p_queue@1.0.0/mod.ts'
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))

const queue = new PQueue()

queue.on('idle', () => {
    console.log(`Queue is idle.  Size: ${queue.size}  Pending: ${queue.pending}`)
})

const job1 = queue.add(() => delay(2000))
const job2 = queue.add(() => delay(500))

await job1
await job2
// => 'Queue is idle.  Size: 0  Pending: 0'

await queue.add(() => delay(600))
// => 'Queue is idle.  Size: 0  Pending: 0'
```

The `idle` event is emitted every time the queue reaches an idle state. On the other hand, the promise the `onIdle()` function returns resolves once the queue becomes idle instead of every time the queue is idle.

### add

Emitted every time the add method is called and the number of pending or queued tasks is increased.

### next

Emitted every time a task is completed and the number of pending or queued tasks is decreased.

``` js
import PQueue from 'https://deno.land/x/p_queue@1.0.0/mod.ts'
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))

const queue = new PQueue()

queue.on('add', () => {
    console.log(`Task is added.  Size: ${queue.size}  Pending: ${queue.pending}`)
})
queue.on('next', () => {
    console.log(`Task is completed.  Size: ${queue.size}  Pending: ${queue.pending}`)
})

const job1 = queue.add(() => delay(2000))
const job2 = queue.add(() => delay(500))

await job1
await job2
//=> 'Task is added.  Size: 0  Pending: 1'
//=> 'Task is added.  Size: 0  Pending: 2'

await queue.add(() => delay(600))
//=> 'Task is completed.  Size: 0  Pending: 1'
//=> 'Task is completed.  Size: 0  Pending: 0'
```

## Advanced example

A more advanced example to help you understand the flow.

``` js
import PQueue from 'https://deno.land/x/p_queue@1.0.0/mod.ts'
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))

const queue = new PQueue({
    concurrency: 1
})

async function taskOne () {
    await delay(200)

    console.log(`8. Pending promises: ${queue.pending}`)
    //=> '8. Pending promises: 0'

    (async () => {
        await queue.add(async () => '🐙')
        console.log('11. Resolved')
    })()

    console.log('9. Added 🐙')

    console.log(`10. Pending promises: ${queue.pending}`)
    //=> '10. Pending promises: 1'

    await queue.onIdle()
    console.log('12. All work is done')
}

async function taskTwo () {
    await queue.add(async () => '🦄')
    console.log('5. Resolved')
}

console.log('1. Added 🦄')

;(async () => {
    await queue.add(async () => '🐴')
    console.log('6. Resolved')
})()
console.log('2. Added 🐴')

;(async () => {
    await queue.onEmpty()
    console.log('7. Queue is empty')
})()

console.log(`3. Queue size: ${queue.size}`)
//=> '3. Queue size: 1`

console.log(`4. Pending promises: ${queue.pending}`)
//=> '4. Pending promises: 1'
```

``` 
$ node example.js

01. Added 🦄
02. Added 🐴
03. Queue size: 1
04. Pending promises: 1
05. Resolved 🦄
06. Resolved 🐴
07. Queue is empty
08. Pending promises: 0
09. Added 🐙
10. Pending promises: 1
11. Resolved 🐙
12. All work is done

```

## Custom QueueClass

For implementing more complex scheduling policies, you can provide a QueueClass in the options:

``` js
class QueueClass {
    constructor() {
        this._queue = []
    }

    enqueue(run, options) {
        this._queue.push(run)
    }

    dequeue() {
        return this._queue.shift()
    }

    get size() {
        return this._queue.length
    }

    filter(options) {
        return this._queue
    }
}

const queue = new PQueue({
    queueClass: QueueClass
})
```

`p-queue` will call corresponding methods to put and get operations from this queue.

## FAQ

#### How do the `concurrency` and `intervalCap` options affect each other?

They are just different constraints. The `concurrency` option limits how many things run at the same time. The `intervalCap` option limits how many things run in total during the interval (over time).
